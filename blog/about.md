# Blog

Here's my blog, essentially a spirtiual successor to my time at the Torch.

Some topics that I'm likely to write about:

* Technology
    * Linux/BSD, and Software Freedom more generally.
    * Also whatever I'm reading/learning about at the time.
* Politics
    * Prepare for takes on Burgerland...
* Catholicism & Religion
    * Also: Modernism *vs* Traditionalism generally
* Reviews
    * Of whatever I think deserves it.
* Anything else that I want to write about.

Not necessarily in that order. Below you'll find links to all of the blog
articles I've written.
