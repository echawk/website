## About

My name is Ethan Hawk, and I'm a recent CS
graduate from Valparaiso University, and this
is my website. Here you'll find write ups of
projects that I've worked on, an archive of
all of the writing that I did while working
for The Torch, the beginnings of a blog, among
other things.

Important note: any of the views/opinions written here are strictly my own.
